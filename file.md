## Steps to Get a License

   First, join our official Discord server to start the process. You will need to use Discord commands to manage your licenses.

2. Link Your Discord Account to BuiltByBit  
   After joining Discord, ensure that your Discord account is linked to your BuiltByBit account. You can do this by visiting your BuiltByBit account settings.

3. Use the /licensecreate Command  
   Once your accounts are linked, you can use the following command in the Discord server to create your license:
   [Code language="javascript" title="Create License"]  
   /licensecreate
   [/Code]  
   After running this command, you’ll be prompted to select the product you wish to create a license for.

5. Managing Your License with /licensedit  
   To edit the details of your license, use the following command:
   [Code language="javascript" title="Edit License"]
